# neutron-thermalization-geant4
This project simulates the thermalization of neutrons in paraffin using Geant4, a Monte Carlo toolkit for particleâ€“matter interactions. The main goal is to analyze how fast neutrons lose energy through successive elastic collisions with hydrogen and carbon atoms in paraffin, eventually reaching thermal equilibrium.
